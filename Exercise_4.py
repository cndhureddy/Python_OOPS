#Dog Walking
'''
Next, add a walk() method to both the Pets and Dog classes so that when you call the method on the Pets class, each dog instance assigned to the Pets class will walk(). Save this as dog_walking.py. This is slightly more difficult.

Start by implementing the method in the same manner as the speak() method. As for the method in the Pets class, you will need to iterate through the list of dogs, then call the method itself.

The output should look like this:

Tom is walking!
Fletcher is walking!
Larry is walking!

# Instantiate the Pet class
my_pets = Pets(my_dogs)

# Output
my_pets.walk()
